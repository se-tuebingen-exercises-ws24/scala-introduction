This repository includes examples introducing the Scala language.

We introduce concepts of the language in comparison to Java (in `src/main/java`) and Racket (in `src/main/racket`).

Topics covered so far:

- build systems (look at `build.sbt` where we added a dependency to parse JSON in `src/main/scala/hello.scala`)
- imperative programming (look at `src/main/scala/imperative.scala` and the corresponding Java file)
- functional programming (look at `src/main/scala/fp.scala` and the corresponding Racket file)
